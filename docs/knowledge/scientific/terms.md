The terminology in the research field of Shape-Changing Interfaces is very heterogenous, reflecting the diversity and also fragmentation of the topic. Some of the terms are influenced by a technological point-of-view, some strive to express the characteristics of the interaction, some are even influenced by philosophical concepts.

## Taxonomy

Our approach for a well-ordered conceptual apparatus places the term **Tangible Interaction** in the center as fundamental concept serves as a common frame to which all other aspects can be related. Tangible Interaction describes research related with specific interaction design concepts as well as specific types of user interfaces.
**Shape-Changing Interfaces** describe user interfaces in the area of Tangible Interaction, including concepts such as *Organic Interface* or *Deformable Interface*. On the conceptual side, these interfaces can be divided into interfaces with **Temporary Deformation** or **Persistent Deformation** or **Actuated Displays**. **Elastic Displays** fit into the first category. The term *Ephemeral Interaction* describes a concept that is closely related to the temporality of the interaction. *Data Physicalitation* again is a concept that serves as one of the core ideas of **Tangible Interaction**
