Our initial efforts on Elastic Displays with the *DepthTouch* Prototype werer merely a tech demo, showcasing the opportunities of using consumer depth sensing hardware for tracking the deformation of an deformable surface.

After this, we stated exploring the bandwidth of different application scenarios by developing the first iteration of what we now call the *ReFlex framework*. Back then, we called it *FlexiWall* and it served as experimental framework for exploring different aspects of layer-based interaction.

While using this framework and conducting research on related works, we tried to find categories in for different use cases for Elastic Displays. This first effort of creating a general understanding resulted in a [Data Type Model](models_data-types.html), accompanied by a categorization of different [Types of Interaction](models_interactions.html) that  can be used with Elastic Displays.

Related to extending the framework and exploring different use cases, as well as discussions with other researchers in this field, the shortcomings of this model became obvious, so we extended it into as [Task Taxonomy](models_task-taxonomy.html). This Taxonomy can be used to analyze, categorize and understand existing prototypes but also to explore novel concepts and use cases by combining the different aspects of this model.

This serves a the theoretical foundation of thr *ReFlex framework* as it covers the technological dimension by providing access to all the features or data needed on this aspect of the taxonomy and also provides the tools for implementing the interaction metaphors proposed by the taxonomy.
