In the context of social challenges, the focus is on the area of **sustainability**, but on many different levels.
The use of simple, standardized hardware conserves resources, as does the high degree of reparability due to the modularity of the system. The establishment of standards and technology is sustainable insofar as redundant new development is avoided and an increase in efficiency can be expected through further development. Documentation and models also contribute to sustainability.
