We address the **Technological Challenges** in the field of Elastic Displays by researching and providing **tools**. The aim is to define *standards* and create a *common technological basis*. **ReFlex**, as a technological **platform**, provides the **stability** and **scalability** that are the prerequisites for continuous research. The underlying *software architecture* ensures both **modularity** and allows to integrate other **modalities**, which can be realized through simple extensibility and the use of *standards*. *Application templates* and support for *multi-platform development* simplify general application development up to **end-user programming**.
