The development of **models** is based on the *abstraction* of findings from individual case studies. This forms the basis for **theory development** and gaining a general understanding of the functionality and usability of Elastic Displays. In addition, is necessary to develop a suitable *terminology* and associated definitions to describe the interface to simplify the comparability of systems.
*User studies* are an elementary part of this process in order to assess the **user experience**. Due to the novelty of the technology, it is necessary to document the experiences from the chosen procedure for  user studies to facilitate evaluations and comparative studies for other researchers. Finally, the *documentation* - together with the common technological basis - serves the goal of **replicability** of results and directly addresses the replication crisis in HCI.
